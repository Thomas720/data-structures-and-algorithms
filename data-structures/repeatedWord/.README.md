- # Find the first repeated word in a book

## Approach & Solution

1. The first Step is Spliting the Strings to Individual words

2. Initiate a hash map so that we can use key-value pairs

3. Initiate an array that will hold the repeated words of the string

4. Create the EDGE-CASE and make sure if the string is empty

5. Make for loop and if the word doesn't exist in the split array, put the word in the hash map.

6. Or Else if the word exists in the hash map, get it

7. loop over the hash array, if the value doesnt exist, push the word into the repeated words array

8. The final Result
