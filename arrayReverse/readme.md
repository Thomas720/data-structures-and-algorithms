# Reverse an Array
* It's a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without ussing any method, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Challenge
* It was very challenging to start getting the idea of revering without using push or pop but finaly i found some surce from YouTube and understand the logic of reversing.

## Approach & Efficiency
I started out by visualizing how my brain tried to solve the problem on its own. Then I created a formula that shows the relationship of the indexes of the elements before and after the reverse.

## Solution
* The solution was to use temp = first, first - last, last = temp algorithm.
